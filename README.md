# Overview
My first SQL Database posted on Github. The database is a unspecified store and within this store I was able to:
* Insert new data into the table
* Modify existing data in the table
* Delete existing data from the table 
* Retrieve data from the table 

# Development Environment

* SQLite
* SQLite Studio GUI

# Execution

To open the database run this file in SQLite: `Store.db`
